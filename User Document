Use Case- Payment (Seth Larson)
The use case "Payment" helps the customer choose their method of payment and if they choose to pay card, takes the card information
to be used by a credit card payment processor. The payment method asks for the credit card number which must contain 15-16 digits, 
the expiration of the card, the zip code of the card, and the security code of the card. The method checks the inputs given by the 
customer to ensure they are only digits, as well as to ensure they are the proper length. When all inputs have been deemed legitimate,
the method ends and thanks the customer for payment. If the customer chooses to pay cash, the method reminds the customer of the total,
and to be ready to pay when the delivery driver arrives at the customer's residence.
